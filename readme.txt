This repository contains the code used in the experiments for the following paper:

"Andrew Cropper and Stephen Muggleton. Learning efficient logical robot strategies involving composable objects. In Proceedings of the 24th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2015). In press."

We used SWI-Prolog, Version 6.6.x for all experiments.

To reproduce the postman results in Fig. 4 and the sorter results in Fig. 6, go to the respective subdirectory and run the run-metagold.bash and run-metagolo.bash bash files. The associated learned programs and test results are stored in the subdirectories results-metagold and results-metagolo.

One can calculate output for the plots using the results.py file.

Note that each experiment take a very long time to run, in excess of 24 hours. This is a limitation of the approach, which we intend to rectify in future work.
